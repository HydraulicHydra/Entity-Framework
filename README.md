# Entity-Framework
These downloads still aren't working properly for me, I'm starting to get frsutrated that I can't properly interact with these and learn how to build them myself.

1) Code first design allows more complete control over the code, database first is harder to modify due to auto-generate code but saves time thanks to the generation of code.  Additionally, you can always directly modify the databse with database first, instead of being locked into what is in the code with code first.

2) Scaffold-DbContext can be used to build up a database structure from scratch, using only 1 entity.

3) DataAnnotations are helpful for simple applications, Fluent API is more complex but has more robust features to work with much more complicated tasks.
